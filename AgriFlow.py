AgriFlow.py

ETL pipeline which uses the etl_components and scripts directories to load data from USDA_API to finally the PostgresQL DB.
Dockerized Application with a .env file for allowing passing of environmental variables.

- Steps (from start to finish)
    - Initialize Mongo Database in MongoDB using personal AWS cluster purposefully started beforehand.
    - MongoDB collections data is brought into psypark dataframes for transformations, (filtering, defining schema, NULL handling) which is then converted into panda dataframes.
    - Panda dataframes are then unioned together to create a single dataframe.
    - Using library PSYCOG2, defined the schema, and dropped the existing landing table, and using the execute_values function to bulk insert dataframe rows into PostgresQL db.
'''

'''
Important Notes: 
- The get_counts function sometimes fails silently, causing the ETL process to run indefinitely while pulling data from the USDA API into MongoDB.
    - To fix this, try commenting out lines 70-74 in USDA_API.py (in .scripts). This function uses requests.get, with the endpoint URL including get_counts.
'''

'''
Future updates
- Using apache airflow to schedule etl.
- Using DBT to ensure data integrity.
